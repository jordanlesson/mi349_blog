        <h5>Why Facebook ($FB) is 2021's Stock Pick of the Year</h5>
        <subtitle1>Author: Jordan Lesson Published: 10/14/2021</subtitle1>
        <p>FB is a great company trading at an undervalued level relative to its future growth opportunity and current
            dominate market share existence. I believe Facebook is not only in a sector with a wide range of growth
            opportunity but they are also going to continue dominating the sector as well.
            Pretty much all of Facebook's business is driven off its users data which is collected interpenetrated and
            used to sell advertisements to businesses targeting a look alike group. Lately Facebook has come under
            scrutiny for controversial practices of collecting and selling data on its customers. This led to the
            justice department talking about how to regulate the social media giant. However what most people don't
            realize is that not all data is equal. You may not want to share your medical records or tax return
            statements with Facebook but do you really care if they know your favorite places to eat? A lot of the data
            Facebook collects is quite harmless yet extremely relevant for companies trying to target ads to their ideal
            customers. Not only do businesses love when they are seeing high conversion rates from their ads but FB
            users also get to enjoy having relevant advertisements of products they would like to purchase based on
            their interdependently chosen feed.

        <h5>Why Most Start Ups Fail</h5>
        <subtitle1>Author: Jordan Lesson Published: 10/14/2021</subtitle1>
        <p>Everyday, people all around the world find themselves bombarded by annoying ads for a new app that is coming
            out or are questioned about if they will buy the latest tech product. Ever since the Internet more
            accessible to the public in the 1990â€™s, inventors and entrepreneurs have been scavenging to create tech
            products or services that change the world much like automobiles did in the early 20th century. Typically,
            these businesses seek out for angel investors, individuals who have a lot of money to invest, to fund all
            the operations of their company. Recently in 2019, technology startups have been spawnings all over the
            country with some having great success while others suffer and go bankrupt even weeks after opening shop.
            Unfortunately for tech startups, failure is an option and usually the route that these companies end up
            going down. Startups can fail to persuade an investor to fund them, underestimate the costs of running their
            operations, or be unsuccessful in attracting users to their product. There are an infinite ways for a tech
            startup to fail, however, some companies like eBay, Amazon, and PayPal were able to overcome all the
            obstacles that come with creating a billion dollar startup because they have excellent management, strict
            and conservative principles, and a balance of technical and business knowledge.</p>
